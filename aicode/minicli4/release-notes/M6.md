# MiniCLI4 M6 Release Notes (Cross-language QA and Release)

Date: 2026-02-27
Milestone: `M6`

## Scope Delivered

- `T18`: Shared cross-language contract runner.
- `T19`: Windows/Linux CI matrix with release checks and artifact upload.
- `T20`: Milestone closeout documentation and sign-off checklist.

## Parity Status

- TypeScript: Completion vector contract checks and CLI smoke checks included in shared runner.
- Python: Completion vector contract checks and CLI smoke checks included in shared runner.
- C++: ctest contract coverage and CLI smoke checks included in shared runner.
- Aggregate status (local run): `PASS` via
  - `python scripts/run_contracts.py --json-report .minicli4/logs/contracts-local.json`

## CI and Artifact Checks

- Added workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- OS matrix: `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`
- CI checks per matrix entry:
  - TypeScript build and completion-contract checks
  - Python completion-contract checks
  - C++ configure/build/ctest checks
  - CLI smoke execution (`--version`) for all implementations
- Uploaded artifacts:
  - Contract JSON report per OS
  - TypeScript build output per OS
  - C++ smoke binary per OS

## Known Risks

- Shared vector baseline currently centers on completion vectors from `spec/test-vectors/completion.*.json`; non-completion contracts remain covered through language-level suites and C++ ctest integration rather than a single cross-language vector corpus.
- CI assumes toolchain availability compatible with Node 22, Python 3.14, and CMake on both matrix OS targets.

## Manual Sign-off Checklist

- [x] Shared runner returns per-language pass/fail and aggregate summary.
- [x] Shared runner can emit machine-readable report artifact.
- [x] CI matrix defined for Windows and Linux.
- [x] CI executes build/test/vector/smoke flow via shared runner.
- [x] CI uploads validation artifacts.
- [x] Milestone closeout notes captured.
