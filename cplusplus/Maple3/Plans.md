# Maple3 Plans

## Current Focus
- Document repository rules and keep project context synchronized.

## Plan
1. Establish and maintain an up-to-date project background and workflow rules.
2. Grow the interpreter pipeline (scanner -> parser -> runtime -> CLI) while keeping codebase small and readable.
3. Add targeted tests under `tests/` as features stabilize.

## Progress Log
- 2026-02-05: Added project background expansion in `AGENTS.md`.
- 2026-02-05: Switched workflow rules to reference `Plans.md`.
- 2026-02-05: Created `Plans.md` with initial plan and progress log.

## Next Steps
1. Keep `Plans.md` updated as work progresses.
